  Hi, my name is <strong>Jiamin Lim</strong>. Aspiring software developer, currently an economist based in Sydney, Australia. I am looking forward to joining the winter cohort for <strong>Founders and Coders</strong>!
</p> 
<p>
  I want to transition to software development as I enjoy the puzzle-solving and creative aspects of it. Strangely enough, looking back, I have been involved in coding in one way or another over the past few years. The evolution of my coding journey can be found below:
  <br>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>2006: My first coding experience was with my personal blog in high school, where I played around with <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> to further customise some of the templates.</li>
  <li>2013-15: While studying economics at university, I self-learnt <strong>R</strong> to complete my econometrics assignments. Later on, I used <strong>R</strong> to conduct data analysis working as an economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia.</li>
  <li>2016: I took a part-time course on Data Science at General Assembly, where I used <strong>Python</strong> to implement machine learning techniques to predict the success of crowdfunding campaigns for microfinance loans (for more info, see my <a href="https://github.com/nimaij/project">Github</a>).</li>
  <li>2017-18: Realising that I was more interested in using coding as a means to create products rather than analyse data, as a fun little side project, I followed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBsvRxJJOzG4r4k_zLKrnxl">youtube tutorial</a> and built a simple meme creator app in <strong>Java</strong> using Android Studio. It was really fun!</li>
  <li>May 2018: I found out about a free Amazon Alexa Dev day event and learnt the 101 on how to implement a voice skill. This made me very curious about what was going on under the hood and also all the fun voice apps you could make with it!</li>
  <li>June 2018: I then took part in <a href="http://www.rhokaustralia.org/">Random Hacks of Kindness</a>, a hackathon where teams come together to help non-for-profits build tech solutions. My team partnered with a charity that works with its volunteer network to provide "free Uber for seniors". We worked closely with the charity to design and build a web-based platform that allowed volunteer drivers to view all available ride requests and sort based on criteria such as time or location. While I was mostly involved in the design and testing, it was very fascinating to see the the front-end and back-end developers working together to bring the project to life!</li>
  <li>July-August 2018: I found out about <strong>Founders and Coders</strong> on a medium blog and was really excited about the peer-led learning model and social purpose aspect to it. Finally managed to finish the prereqs and apply for the winter cohort!</li>
  <li>September 2018: <strong>To be continued...</strong>
